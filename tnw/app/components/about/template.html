<h1>About</h1>
<h3>Phrase's foundation</h3>
<p>Phrase is a child company of Basecamp Ventures, founded by Mel Baiada. Phrase is an annotation tool for teachers and students; the tool is created, advertised, and run by high school and college students with the main purpose of earning experience running a startup. This tool has been worked on each year by a different group of students, each group building off the previous year's work.</p>
<h3>Meaningful interactions</h3>
<p>Interacting with primary documents is an important skill, especially in high school, but it can be difficult to do so in a meaningful way. The purpose of Phrase is to allow teachers and students in the same network to save documents to a central place and add relevant interpretations and comments.</p>
<h3>Preparing for the future</h3>
<p>Phrase helps students learn important note-taking and annotation skills for the future. Connecting students and teachers in an online note-sharing class is what Phrase does like no other online tool does. Phrase is dedicated to better learning and students learning from one another, which is inspired by the Harkness method. Phrase helps students with better analytical input and learning through other students in an online, open-sharing/open-discussion format, which makes it the best tool in the EdTech market.</p>
